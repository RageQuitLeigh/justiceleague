    <p>Zack Synder's Justice League can be summed up fairly easily as being almost completely different to the 2017 cut of the same movie. Having been heavily cut, majorly reshot and presented with a different emphasis following Zack Synder leaving
      during it's production the original movie lacked direction, heart, motive for most characters (good characters or bad) and resulted in a movie that failed to provide interest for viewer. This new 2021 version solves and satisfies all the
      issues.
      <br>
      <br>
      ZSJC follows on from 'Batman vs Superman' in the aftermath of a world without Superman. It's this lack protection for earth that make all conquering beings from across the galaxy aware that the planet now ripe for the taking. The main
      antagonist is Steppenwolf who is challenged by his leader to take over earth, in order to do this he must search out and reclaim ancient alien technology left on earth many centuries ago when humans and earth gods defended the planet from a an
      invasion. The movie essentially is about Bruce Wayne bringing together a group of heroes to take on this invasion.
      <br>
      <br>
      The core story remains fairly similar to the 2017 efforts but it is told in a much more cohesive way by introducing all of the characters in depth, bringing us up to speed on who, why and what they are. You have to remember that at the time of
      original release we had only be introduced to Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman in previous movies. Without any back story, the new characters literally had no motivation to be there. In this version Cyborg steals the show, not only in the
      actor's performance but the character as the heart of the whole movie, in 2017s version he seemed like an afterthought or just to tick boxes.
      <br>
      <br>
      This movie is 4 hours long. However it is highly engrossing, particularly if you have any vested interested in the previous films, the DC franchise or just Batman. I suspect that non fans of the genre will not find this half as entertaining.
      That being said the movie screams epic, in its size, its ability to carefully handle so many characters and to tell a story where the characters are in serious jeopardy. It might not quite hit the heights of Marvel's Infinity War, but for me,
      it's quite close and definitely sits proud as one of the best superhero/comic book movies.
      <br>
      <br>
      The saddest part is how open ended the movie is and the multiple teasers for further stories throughout the movie, that originally had intention to be separate movies, which are no longer in production at the time of writing this review. I hope
      that I can look back at this review in years to come having seen them come to fruition off the back of the clear success Zack Synder's Justice League really was..
